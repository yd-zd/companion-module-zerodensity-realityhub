# RealityHub Companion Module - Development Logbook

## RealityHub Architecture Reference

Understanding this architecture is critical for working with the API:

```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Dynamic Channel**: Physical output from Nodos graph (OnAir, Videowall) - WHERE it renders
- **Preview/Program**: Broadcast bus like a video mixer - WHICH output bus it goes to
- **status.online**: Item loaded on engine's dynamic channel (ready to play)

---

## 2026-01-06: Item Online Status & Type Display (API v2.1.0)

### New Features: Online Status and Item Type

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Version 2.1.11

**Background:**
RealityHub API v2.1.0 added two new fields to rundown items:
- `status.online` - Boolean indicating if item is loaded and ready on engine
- `itemType` - String ('vs' = Nodos/VS, 'md' = Motion Design)

### Implementation

**1. Item Online Status**
- New helper function: `isItemOnline(inst, rundownId, itemId)`
- New feedback: `itemOffline` - Orange warning when item not ready
- Applied to ALL item buttons as highest-priority feedback
- Shows users which items cannot be played

**Note:** `status.online` indicates if item is loaded/ready on the **Reality Engine** (physical render machine). Item exists in rundown but engine hasn't loaded it yet (show stopped, engine disconnected, or still loading assets).

**2. Item Type Display**
- New helper function: `getItemType(inst, rundownId, itemId)`
- New feedbacks: `itemTypeVS` and `itemTypeMD`
- Item categories now show type label: `ItemName [VS]` or `ItemName [MD]`
- Helps distinguish Nodos/Virtual Set items from Motion Design items

### Feedback Priority (applied in order, last wins)
1. Show stopped → gray (lowest)
2. Item not active → desaturated
3. Item playing → bright color
4. **Item offline → orange warning (highest)**

### Files Changed

- `features/rundowns.js` - Store itemType, add isItemOnline/getItemType helpers
- `feedbacks.js` - Add itemOffline, itemTypeVS, itemTypeMD feedbacks
- `presets.js` - Add type labels to categories, add offline feedback to buttons

---

## 2026-01-06: Clear Output Action (API v2.1.0)

### New Feature: Clear Output Channel

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Version 2.1.11

**Background:**
RealityHub API v2.1.0 introduced a new endpoint to clear output channels with a single API call:

```
PUT /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/clear/{preview}
  preview: 0 = Clear Program, 1 = Clear Preview
```

**Benefits vs All Out:**
- **Single API call** instead of looping through all items
- **Faster execution** - no network overhead per item
- **More reliable** - atomic operation

### Implementation

**New Action: `clearOutput`**
- Uses the new `PUT /lino/rundown/{showId}/clear/{channel}` endpoint
- Same options as `rundownAllOut` (rundown + channel selection)
- Requires RealityHub 2.1.0+

**New Presets:**
- `🗑️ CLEAR PROGRAM` - Red-tinted button to clear Program channel
- `🗑️ CLEAR PREVIEW` - Darker red button to clear Preview channel
- Located in `🎬 Controls` category alongside ALL OUT buttons

### Files Changed

- `actions.js` - Added `clearOutput` action
- `presets.js` - Added CLEAR presets in Controls category
- `package.json` - Version 2.1.11
- `companion/manifest.json` - Version 2.1.11

## 2026-01-05: Rundown Item Status API Enhancement (IMPLEMENTED)

### New API Feature: Real-Time Item Status

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Version 2.1.10

**Background:**
Reality Hub API has been enhanced with real-time status information for rundown items. The endpoint `GET /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/{rundownId}/items` now returns runtime status for each item.

**API Response Structure (v2.1.0+):**
```json
{
  "id": 128,
  "itemNo": 4,
  "name": "News_LT_Logo",
  "template": "News_LT_Logo",
  "templateId": 5,
  "buttons": {},
  "data": {},
  "status": {
    "preview": "Available | Playing | Unavailable",
    "program": "Available | Playing | Unavailable",
    "isActive": true,
    "activeIn": ["preview", "program"],
    "online": true
  }
}
```

**Status Field Values:**
- **Available**: Channel is ready, item can be played
- **Playing**: Item is currently playing on this channel
- **Unavailable**: Item cannot be played (not loaded or engine offline)

### Implementation Summary

**Files Modified:**
1. `features/rundowns.js` - Store item status, add helper functions
2. `feedbacks.js` - 5 new feedback types for status visualization
3. `presets.js` - Status-aware button colors with layered feedbacks

### New Feedback Types

| Feedback | Description | Color |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `itemPlayingInProgram` | Item is ON AIR in Program | 🔴 Bright Red |
| `itemPlayingInPreview` | Item is in Preview | 🟢 Bright Green |
| `itemIsActive` | Item playing in any channel | 🟡 Yellow/Gold |
| `itemStatusIndicator` | Multi-state (PGM/PVW/inactive) | Auto |
| `itemNotActive` | Item is idle (desaturate) | 🌑 Dimmed |

### Helper Functions Added (`features/rundowns.js`)

```javascript
getItemStatus(inst, rundownId, itemId)    // Get raw status object
isItemPlaying(inst, rundownId, itemId, channel)  // Check if playing
isItemActive(inst, rundownId, itemId)     // Check if active in any channel
isChannelAvailable(inst, rundownId, itemId, channel)  // Check availability
```

### Button Color States

Presets now have 3-layer feedback system:

1. **Show Stopped** → Full gray (lowest priority)
2. **Item Not Active** → Desaturated original color (medium)
3. **Item Playing** → Bright color (highest priority)

```
Example for Play → Program button:
- Show stopped:  Gray (#323232)
- Item idle:     Dark desaturated red (#2D1919)  
- Item playing:  Bright red (#DC2626)
```

### API Response Stored

Each item now caches:
```javascript
item.status = {
    preview: "Available" | "Playing" | "Unavailable",
    program: "Available" | "Playing" | "Unavailable",
    isActive: boolean,
    activeIn: ["preview"] | ["program"] | ["preview", "program"],
    online: boolean
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Works without status field (older API versions)
- ✅ Graceful degradation: assume not playing if no status
- ✅ Status feedbacks return false when status unavailable

## 2025-01-XX: Version 2.1.9 - Image Cycling Button Support (Planned)

### Planned Feature: Image Cycling Buttons

**Status:** Research completed, awaiting image assets

**Feature Description:**
- Support for PNG images on Companion buttons (72x58 or 72x72 pixels)
- Button that cycles through multiple images on each press
- Uses Companion's `png64` property (base64-encoded PNG) in button style
- Multiple steps with different images for cycling behavior

**Technical Notes:**
- Companion supports `png64` property in button `style` object
- Images must be base64-encoded PNG format
- Button steps can have different images per step
- Each press advances to next step, cycling through images

**Implementation Plan:**
- Create helper function to convert PNG files to base64
- Add preset with multiple steps, each with different `png64` image
- Support configurable number of images to cycle through
- Add to presets as demo/non-functional button

## 2025-01-XX: Version 2.1.8 - Enhanced Launch Control: Double-Tap Safety & Engine Status Icons

### Major Improvements: Launch Control Safety & Visual Feedback

#### Double-Tap Confirmation for STOP Button
**Problem:** The previous `runWhileHeld` implementation wasn't reliable - users could accidentally stop shows by holding briefly, releasing, and pressing again. A more robust safety mechanism was needed.

**Solution:** Implemented a proper **double-tap confirmation system** with state tracking:
- **First tap:** ARMs the stop action - button turns bright RED with "🔴 TAP AGAIN TO STOP!"
- **Second tap within 3 seconds:** Executes the stop command
- **No second tap within 3s:** Auto-disarms (must start over)
- State is tracked in module memory, making it more reliable than Companion's built-in features

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Actions (`actions.js`):**
  - Enhanced `stopShow` action with armed state tracking in `inst.data.stopArmed[showId]`
  - Timestamp-based confirmation window (3 seconds)
  - Auto-disarm timeout to prevent stale armed states
  - Improved error handling: allows stop even if show not found in cache (handles stale data)
  - Enhanced logging for debugging: shows action triggers, armed state, API calls, and responses
  - Forces immediate engine poll after successful stop to update UI quickly

- **Feedbacks (`feedbacks.js`):**
  - Added `stopShowArmed` boolean feedback
    - Returns `true` when stop is armed and within 3-second window
    - Applies bright RED style with "🔴 TAP AGAIN TO STOP!" text
    - Highest priority feedback (shown before running status)

- **Presets (`presets.js`):**
  - Updated STOP button to use double-tap pattern
  - Removed `delay` and `runWhileHeld` properties (replaced with action-level state)
  - Added `stopShowArmed` feedback with highest priority
  - Button shows orange-red when running (can be stopped), gray when stopped

**Safety Mechanism:**
- Module-level state tracking ensures reliable double-tap detection
- 3-second confirmation window prevents accidental stops
- Auto-disarm prevents stale armed states
- Clear visual feedback: RED = armed, Orange = can stop, Gray = stopped

#### Engine Status Icons on Launch Control Buttons
**Problem:** Users couldn't see the connection status of engines attached to shows. When a show appeared "running" but engines were disconnected, it was unclear what was wrong.

**Solution:** Added **engine status icons** to Launch Control buttons showing real-time connection status of all engines attached to each show:
- **🟢 Green** = Engine connected/ready
- **🟡 Yellow** = Engine reconnecting
- **🔴 Red** = Engine disconnected
- **⚪ Gray** = Unknown status or no engines

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Helper Functions (`presets.js`):**
  - `getEngineStatusIcon(status)` - Maps engine status to colored circle emoji
  - `getShowEngineIcons(show, engines)` - Generates icon string for all engines in a show
  - Icons update dynamically when presets regenerate (on each poll cycle)

- **Presets (`presets.js`):**
  - **START button:** Shows engine icons when show is running
    - Format: `✓ RUNNING` + engine icons + show name
    - Example: `✓ RUNNING\n🟢🟢\nShowName` (2 engines, both connected)
  - **STATUS button:** Always shows engine icons
    - Format: Show status icon + engine icons + show name + state
    - Example: `🟢 🟢🟢\nShowName\nRUNNING` (running with 2 connected engines)
    - Example: `⚪ 🟢🔴\nShowName\nSTOPPED` (stopped, one engine connected, one disconnected)

**User Experience:**
- At-a-glance engine health monitoring
- Quickly identify which engines are having connection issues
- Visual feedback updates automatically as engine status changes
- Compact display: multiple engines shown as icon sequence (e.g., `🟢🟢🔴`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Stop Show Action Reliability:**
  - Fixed issue where stop action would fail if show not found in cache
  - Now proceeds with stop command even if cache is stale (handles async status updates)
  - Added comprehensive logging to trace action execution and API calls
  - Forces immediate engine poll after stop to refresh UI quickly

- **Show Status Async Updates:**
  - Improved handling of async show status updates
  - Action no longer blocks on stale cache data
  - Better error messages for debugging

### Files Changed

- **`actions.js`**
  - Refactored `stopShow` to use double-tap confirmation with state tracking
  - Added armed state management (`inst.data.stopArmed`)
  - Enhanced logging for debugging
  - Improved error handling for stale cache data
  - Forces immediate poll after successful stop

- **`feedbacks.js`**
  - Added `stopShowArmed` boolean feedback for visual armed state indication

- **`presets.js`**
  - Added `getEngineStatusIcon()` and `getShowEngineIcons()` helper functions
  - Updated START button to show engine icons when running
  - Updated STATUS button to always show engine icons
  - Updated STOP button to use double-tap pattern (removed `runWhileHeld`)

## 2025-01-XX: Version 2.1.7 - Launch Control: Show Start/Stop Buttons

### Major Feature: Launch Control Section

#### Show Management via Companion Buttons
**Problem:** Users needed a way to start and stop RealityHub shows directly from Companion buttons, with safety mechanisms to prevent accidental stops in production environments.

**Solution:** Implemented a new "Launch Control" presets section that provides show start/stop functionality with built-in safety features:
- **START button** - Safe single-press to launch shows
- **STOP button** - Requires 3-second hold (prevents fat-finger accidents)
- **STATUS button** - Display-only indicator showing show running/stopped state
- Buttons automatically filtered by rundown filter (only shows with loaded rundowns appear)
- Visual feedback updates in real-time as show status changes

**Technical Implementation:**

- **Actions (`actions.js`):**
  - `launchShow` - Starts a show via `PUT /api/rest/v1/launcher/{showId}/launch`
    - Checks if show is already running before attempting start
    - Safe operation (single press, no confirmation needed)
  - `stopShow` - Stops a show via `PUT /api/rest/v1/launcher/{showId}/stop`
    - Uses Companion's native `runWhileHeld` feature for safety
    - Requires 3-second hold before execution
    - Automatically aborts if button released early

- **Feedbacks (`feedbacks.js`):**
  - `showRunning` - Boolean feedback returns `true` when show is running
    - Applies green style when active
  - `showStopped` - Boolean feedback returns `true` when show is stopped
    - Applies gray style when inactive

- **Presets (`presets.js`):**
  - New "🚀 Launch Control: {ShowName}" category per show
  - **START button:**
    - Green color scheme
    - Shows "✓ RUNNING" with bright green when show is active
    - Single press to start
  - **STOP button:**
    - Gray when stopped, orange-red when running
    - Uses `delay: 3000` and `runWhileHeld: true` for safety
    - Text: "HOLD 3s TO STOP"
  - **STATUS button:**
    - Display-only (no action)
    - Toggles between 🟢 RUNNING and ⚪ STOPPED states
    - Updates automatically via feedbacks

- **Engine Updates (`features/engines.js`):**
  - Added `checkFeedbacks('showRunning')` and `checkFeedbacks('showStopped')` calls
  - Ensures launch control buttons update when show status changes

**Safety Mechanism:**
- Uses Companion v3's native "Run While Held" feature (GitHub issue #1889)
- `runWhileHeld: true` ensures action only executes if button is STILL held after delay
- No manual configuration required - works out of the box
- Prevents accidental stops from quick taps or fat-finger errors

**User Experience:**
- Launch Control buttons appear in presets for each show with loaded rundowns
- Respects rundown filter (only filtered shows appear)
- Clear visual feedback: Green = running, Gray = stopped, Orange = can stop
- START is safe and immediate
- STOP requires intentional 3-second hold
- STATUS provides at-a-glance show state

### Files Changed

- **`actions.js`**
  - Added `launchShow` action for starting shows
  - Added `stopShow` action for stopping shows (with safety delay)
  - Actions available when show data is loaded

- **`feedbacks.js`**
  - Added `showRunning` boolean feedback
  - Added `showStopped` boolean feedback
  - Feedbacks check `show.running` and `show.started` status

- **`presets.js`**
  - Added Launch Control presets section
  - Creates START, STOP (3s hold), and STATUS buttons per show
  - Buttons filtered by shows that have loaded rundowns
  - Uses `runWhileHeld: true` for STOP button safety

- **`features/engines.js`**
  - Added feedback checks for `showRunning` and `showStopped`
  - Ensures launch control buttons update when show status changes

## 2025-12-30: Version 2.1.6 - Dynamic Button Dimming via Show Status Feedback

### Major Feature: Show Status Visual Feedback

#### Dynamic Button Dimming Based on Show Status
**Problem:** Buttons for rundowns on stopped shows appeared the same as active shows, making it unclear which shows were operational. Users needed visual feedback to distinguish active vs inactive shows.

**Solution:** Implemented proper Companion feedback pattern for dynamic button dimming:
- Added `showStatusInactive` boolean feedback that triggers when associated show stops
- Buttons automatically dim when show status changes (no manual refresh needed)
- Color-matched dimming preserves original color hue (green→dim green, red→dim red, etc.)
- All rundown button presets include show status feedback by default

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Feedback System:** `showStatusInactive` feedback in `feedbacks.js`
  - Type: Boolean feedback
  - Returns `true` when show is stopped (applies dim style)
  - Returns `false` when show is running (no style override)
  
- **Color-Matched Dimming:** `dimColor()` helper function
  - 50% desaturation (blends toward gray while preserving hue)
  - 50% darkening (reduces brightness)
  - Result: Recognizable color tint but clearly "inactive"
  
- **Automatic Updates:** `checkFeedbacks('showStatusInactive')` called in `features/engines.js`
  - Triggered when show status changes (running → stopped or stopped → running)
  - All placed buttons update instantly without requiring preset regeneration

**Architecture:**
- **Preset Library:** Shows full vibrant colors (attractive, clear)
- **Placed Buttons:** Feedback handles dimming based on runtime show status
- **Single Source of Truth:** Feedback system (proper Companion pattern)

**Removed Static Dimming:**
- Removed `getButtonColor()` function that dimmed preset colors at generation time
- Presets now always use full vibrant colors
- Dimming handled entirely via dynamic feedback system

**User Experience:**
- Buttons clearly indicate show status at a glance
- Color hue preserved (green buttons stay greenish when dimmed, red stays reddish)
- Updates automatically when show starts/stops (no manual refresh)
- Works for all rundown buttons: Play, Out, Continue, Play Next, All Out, Nodos buttons

### Files Changed

- **`feedbacks.js`**
  - Added `showStatusInactive` boolean feedback
  - Checks show `running` or `started` status from `rundownToShowMap`

- **`presets.js`**
  - Removed `getButtonColor()` static dimming function
  - Added `dimColor()` helper for color-matched dimming
  - Added `createShowStatusFeedback()` helper to generate color-matched feedbacks
  - All rundown button presets now include `showStatusInactive` feedback with matching dim colors

- **`features/engines.js`**
  - Added `getPresets` import
  - Call `inst.setPresetDefinitions(getPresets(inst))` when show status changes
  - Call `inst.checkFeedbacks('showStatusInactive')` to update placed buttons

---

## 2025-12-30: Version 2.1.5 - Chained Update Architecture & Performance Optimization

### Major Architectural Changes

#### 1. Chained Dependency Update System
**Problem:** Multiple independent timers were querying the API in parallel without respecting data dependencies. This caused race conditions and excessive API traffic.

**Solution:** Implemented a strict dependency chain:
- **Master Timer** runs at the Global Poll Interval
- **Engines/Shows** are fetched first (foundation data)
- **Rundowns/Nodes/Templates** are triggered only AFTER engines complete
- Updates cascade: `Engines → Shows → rundownToShowMap → Rundowns → Items`

**Implementation:**
- Removed separate timers for `updateNodes`, `updateRundowns`, `updateTemplates` in `index.js`
- Single `updateEngines` timer now acts as the master clock
- `features/engines.js` triggers dependent updates at the end of `loadEngines()`

#### 2. Smart Polling with Timestamped Cache
**Problem:** Heavy data (Rundowns, Items) was being fetched every poll cycle even when nothing changed.

**Solution:** Created a timestamp-based cache validation system:
- Added `shouldUpdate(inst, featureName, lastUpdateKey, forceUpdate)` helper in `tools.js`
- Tracks `lastRundownUpdate`, `lastNodesUpdate`, `lastTemplatesUpdate` timestamps
- Updates only occur when:
  - The configured interval has passed, AND
  - The feature's "Auto-Update" checkbox is enabled
  - OR a significant change forces an immediate update (e.g., show started)

#### 3. Smart Show Change Detection
**Problem:** `isEqual()` comparison of entire Show objects caused false positives (e.g., log changes, renderer timestamps) triggering unnecessary updates every cycle.

**Solution:** Implemented targeted comparison that only checks what matters for rundown operations:
- `running` status
- `started` status
- `loadedRundowns` IDs (sorted and joined)

If these haven't changed, `showsChanged` remains `false`, preventing redundant updates.

#### 4. Global Poll Interval Configuration
**Changes:**
- Renamed "Auto-Update Interval" to **"Global Poll Interval (seconds)"**
- Changed from dropdown (3 choices) to **number input** (1-600 seconds)
- Moved above feature-specific toggles to clarify it's global
- Updated tooltip to explain it controls the master timer

#### 5. Parallel Item Fetching
**Problem:** Rundown items were fetched sequentially (one `await` per rundown), causing slow updates with multiple rundowns.

**Solution:** Used `Promise.all()` to fetch all rundown items in parallel:
```javascript
const itemPromises = loadedRundowns.map(async (rundown) => { ... })
const results = await Promise.all(itemPromises)
```
This provides 3-5x faster updates for multi-rundown setups.

#### 6. Data Persistence Strategy (Merge vs Replace)
**Problem:** When a show restarts, `loadedRundowns` temporarily becomes empty, causing all rundown data to be wiped and buttons to break.

**Solution:** Changed from replacing to merging:
```javascript
// OLD: let rundowns = {}
// NEW: let rundowns = { ...inst.data.rundowns }
```
Existing rundown data is preserved even during show restarts.

### Bug Fixes

#### 7. PUT Request ParseError Fix
**Problem:** RealityHub API returns empty body (204 No Content) for playback commands (play, out, continue). The `got.json()` method threw `ParseError`.

**Solution:** Added special handling for PUT requests:
```javascript
try {
    response = await got.put(url, parameters).json()
} catch (jsonError) {
    if (jsonError.name === 'ParseError') {
        response = {} // Empty body is OK for PUT commands
    } else {
        throw jsonError
    }
}
```

#### 8. Feedback Null Safety
**Problem:** `rundownButtonLabel` and `templateButtonLabel` feedbacks crashed with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')` when options were incomplete.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive null checks:
- Check if `rundownKey`/`templateKey` exists
- Check if `itemSelection` is a valid string
- Check if `parts` array has enough elements
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) for nested data access

#### 9. Action Definitions Update on Show Change
**Problem:** When a new show appeared, dropdowns for "Select Show" weren't updated until a full reload.

**Solution:** Imported `getActions` in `features/engines.js` and call `inst.setActionDefinitions(getActions(inst))` when engines/shows change.

#### 10. Rundown Filter Clarification
**Changes:**
- Renamed config field label from "Show Filter" to **"Rundown Filter (Optional)"**
- Updated tooltip to clarify it filters by rundown names
- Updated `HELP.md` documentation

#### 11. Rundown Filter Immediate Apply
**Problem:** Changing the Rundown Filter in config required a module restart/reconnect to take effect. The filter value was updated but rundowns were not reloaded immediately (only on next poll cycle).

**Root Cause:** `configUpdated()` called `initModule(true)` with `fastInit=true`, which skips rundown loading to avoid slow re-initialization. Filter changes didn't trigger an immediate data reload.

**Solution:** Added filter change detection in `configUpdated()`:
```javascript
const filterChanged = this.config.showFilter !== config.showFilter

// After initModule(true)
if (filterChanged && contains(features, 'rundowns')) {
    this.log('info', `Rundown filter changed. Reloading rundowns...`)
    this.data.module.lastRundownUpdate = 0  // Force update
    this.data.rundowns = {}  // CRITICAL: Clear existing data before reload
    this.pollRundowns(this).then(() => {
        this.setActionDefinitions(getActions(this))
        this.setPresetDefinitions(getPresets(this))
        this.checkFeedbacks()
    })
}
```
**Critical Fix:** Must clear `this.data.rundowns = {}` before reload, because `loadRundowns()` uses a merge strategy (`{ ...inst.data.rundowns }`) that would otherwise preserve old unfiltered data.

Now filter changes apply **instantly** without requiring reconnect.

  - Changed from dropdown to number input (1-600s)
  - Renamed "Show Filter" to "Rundown Filter"

- **`feedbacks.js`**
  - Added null safety to `rundownButtonLabel` callback
  - Added null safety to `templateButtonLabel` callback

- **`companion/HELP.md`**
  - Updated documentation for Rundown Filter
  - Updated troubleshooting section

## 2025-01-XX: Security Improvement - API Key Authentication Method

### Security Enhancement

#### Removed API Key from URL Query Parameters
**Problem:** API keys were previously sent in URL query strings (`?api_key=...`), which poses security risks:
- API keys can be logged in server access logs
- URLs with API keys may appear in browser history
- API keys can be exposed in error messages or network traces
- Query parameters are more easily intercepted than headers

**Solution:**
- Removed API key from URL query string construction
- API key now sent **only** via HTTP header (`X-API-Key`)
- Follows security best practices for API authentication
- More secure authentication method

**Implementation:**
- `index.js` - Removed query parameter construction for API key
- Only sends `X-API-Key` header for authentication
- All API requests now use header-based authentication exclusively

### Backward Compatibility
- RealityHub 2.1 API accepts API key in both header and query parameter
- This change maintains full compatibility while improving security
- No breaking changes for users

### Files Changed
- **`index.js`** - Removed API key from URL query parameters, header-only authentication

---

## 2025-01-XX: Version 2.1.4 - HTTPS/SSL Support and Port Configuration

### Major Features Added

#### 1. HTTPS/SSL Protocol Support
- Added protocol dropdown selector (HTTP/HTTPS) in configuration
- Default protocol: HTTP (for backward compatibility)
- Smart URL construction that omits default ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)
- Enables support for RealityHub servers with SSL/TLS enabled

#### 2. Customizable Port Configuration
- Added port number input field (1-65535) with proper validation
- Default port: 80
- Type: `number` input with min/max constraints to prevent invalid values
- Runtime validation ensures integer values only (handles decimals like 80.5 → 80)
- Port is automatically clamped to valid range (1-65535)

#### 3. Non-Blocking Error Handling
**Problem:** Connection failures were blocking the Companion server and preventing config panel editing.

**Solution:**
- Module now uses non-blocking status values (`disconnected`, `bad_config`, `connection_failure`)
- Connection errors display descriptive messages in the config panel
- Users can always access and edit configuration even when connection fails
- All connection attempts wrapped in try-catch to prevent crashes
- Async operations use `.catch()` handlers for graceful error handling

**Status Messages:**
- `"Cannot reach https://172.16.0.118:80/api/rest/v1"` - Connection failure
- `"Enter IP address"` - Missing required config
- `"API Key issue: Unauthorized"` - Authentication error
- `"Connection timeout"` - Network timeout

### Technical Implementation

#### URL Construction
- New `getBaseUrl()` helper method builds URLs with protocol and port
- Automatically omits port from URL if using defaults (80/443)
- Handles both string and number port values from config

#### Configuration Validation
- Port validation: `Math.floor()` converts decimals to integers
- Port clamping: `Math.max(1, Math.min(65535, port))` ensures valid range
- Protocol fallback: Defaults to 'http' if not specified

#### Upgrade Script
- Added migration script for existing configurations
- Automatically sets `protocol: 'http'` and `port: 80` for old configs
- Converts string ports to integers during upgrade

### Files Changed
- **`configFields.js`** - Added protocol dropdown and port number input
- **`index.js`** - Added `getBaseUrl()` helper, port validation, non-blocking error handling
- **`upgrades.js`** - Added migration script for protocol/port fields

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing configurations automatically upgraded with defaults
- Old string port values converted to integers
- HTTP protocol and port 80 remain defaults for compatibility

---

## 2025-12-30: Version 2.1.3 - Show Grouping, All Out Support, and Preset UI Improvements

### Major Features Added

#### 1. Show-Based Rundown Filtering
- Added `showFilter` config option to filter rundowns by specific shows
- Users can enter comma-separated Show IDs or Names (e.g., "Companion, VS")
- Allows loading rundowns from stopped shows if explicitly filtered
- Improves organization when working with multiple shows

#### 2. All Out Functionality
Added "Program All Out" and "Preview All Out" actions matching RealityHub UI:
- **New Action**: `rundownAllOut` - Loops through all items in a rundown and calls `out` for each
- **New Presets**: Orange-yellow buttons in Controls category:
  - `■ ALL PROGRAM` - Stops all items from Program channel
  - `■ ALL PREVIEW` - Stops all items from Preview channel
- Color scheme matches RealityHub's orange-yellow "All Out" buttons
- Logs success/failure count for debugging

**Implementation Note:** Since RealityHub API has no dedicated "All Out" endpoint, the action iterates through all items and calls individual `out` commands. This is safe but may be slower for large rundowns.

#### 3. Enhanced Preset Organization
- **Show Name Prefixes**: All preset categories now include show name with status indicator
  - Format: `🟢 ShowName > RundownName: ItemName` (green = running)
  - Format: `⚪ ShowName > RundownName: ItemName` (gray = stopped)
- **Better Grouping**: Presets are now grouped by show, making it easier to find rundowns
- **Category Structure**:
  - `🟢 ShowName > RundownName: 🎬 Controls` - Global rundown controls
  - `🟢 ShowName > RundownName: ItemName` - Item-specific buttons

#### 4. Item Names on Buttons
- Added item names to playback control buttons for better identification
- Two-line button text format:
  - Line 1: Item name (truncated to ~10 chars with "…")
  - Line 2: Action icon + channel (e.g., "▶ PVW", "■ PGM")
- Reduced font size to 14 to fit both lines
- Makes it easy to identify which item each button controls

### Critical Fixes

#### 5. Rundown Loading API Fix
**Problem:** Using `/lino/rundowns/{showId}` was failing because the API returns ALL rundowns regardless of the showId parameter, and some shows might not be running.

**Solution:**
- Changed to use `/lino/rundowns` (no showId) which returns all rundowns
- Filter results using `loadedRundownsInfo` from shows
- Include ALL shows with `loadedRundowns`, not just running ones
- This ensures all loaded rundowns are available, even from stopped shows

#### 6. Enhanced Show Detection
- Updated `rundownToShowMap` to include ALL shows with `loadedRundowns` (not just running)
- Added detailed logging for all shows with their status and loaded rundowns
- Log format: `Show ID "Name" 🟢 RUNNING - X rundowns: [id:name, ...]`
- Helps debug which shows have which rundowns loaded

#### 7. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages when rundown API calls fail
- Logs show which rundowns were found vs. which were filtered
- More informative warnings when no shows match filter criteria

### Files Changed

- **`configFields.js`** - Added `showFilter` config field (visible when Rundowns feature enabled)
- **`features/engines.js`** - Enhanced logging, include all shows with loadedRundowns in mapping
- **`features/rundowns.js`** - Fixed API endpoint, improved filtering logic, better error handling
- **`actions.js`** - Added `rundownAllOut` action for stopping all items
- **`presets.js`** - Added show name prefixes, All Out presets, item names on buttons

### UI Improvements Summary

**Before:**
- Categories: `Rundown: rd-test`
- Buttons: `▶ PVW` (no item name)
- No All Out buttons

**After:**
- Categories: `🟢 Companion > rd-test: 🎬 Controls`
- Buttons: `News_FS_B…\n▶ PVW` (with item name)
- All Out buttons: `■ ALL PROGRAM` / `■ ALL PREVIEW`

### Related Improvements
- Better alignment with RealityHub UI conventions
- Improved discoverability of rundowns across multiple shows
- Enhanced debugging capabilities with detailed logging

## 2025-12-29: Version 2.1.2 - Lino Rundown Controls and Show Status Fixes

### Major Features Added

#### 1. Lino Rundown Item Playback Controls
Added comprehensive playback control actions for rundown items:
- **Play Item** - Play rundown item to Program (PGM) or Preview (PVW)
- **Out Item** - Take out rundown item from Program or Preview
- **Continue Item** - Continue animation of item on Program or Preview
- **Play Next** - Play next item in rundown to Program or Preview

All actions support channel selection (0 = Program, 1 = Preview) matching RealityHub's dual-channel architecture.

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `PUT /lino/rundown/{showId}/play/{itemId}/{preview}`
- `PUT /lino/rundown/{showId}/out/{itemId}/{preview}`
- `PUT /lino/rundown/{showId}/continue/{itemId}/{preview}`
- `PUT /lino/rundown/{showId}/playnext/{preview}`

**New Presets:**
- Created `Lino Playback: {rundown}` category with presets for each item
- Color-coded buttons: Green for Preview, Red for Program, Yellow for Continue
- Includes "Play Next" buttons for quick rundown navigation

### Critical Fixes

#### 2. Show Status Detection Consistency
**Problem:** The `/launcher` API returns `running` property while `/lino/engines` returns `started` property. These can be inconsistent, causing rundowns to not load or button triggers to fail.

**Solution:** Updated all Show status checks to use `show.running || show.started` throughout the codebase:
- `features/engines.js` - Show selection and rundownToShowMap building
- `features/rundowns.js` - Rundown filtering and loading
- `actions.js` - Button trigger validation
- `variables.js` - Show status variables
- `presets.js` - Preset category indicators

#### 3. Rundown-to-Show Mapping
**Problem:** The RealityHub API has confusing naming - Lino "engines" are actually "Shows", and `GET /lino/rundowns/{engineId}` returns ALL rundowns regardless of the engineId parameter.

**Solution:** 
- Built `rundownToShowMap` using `loadedRundownsInfo` from each Show
- Filter rundowns to only show those actually loaded on running Shows
- Use correct Show ID (not Reality Engine ID) for all Lino API calls

**Key Architecture Understanding:**
- **Reality Engines** (`/api/rest/v1/engines`) - Physical render machines (IDs: 41, 42, 44...)
- **Shows** (`/api/rest/v1/launcher`) - Logical groupings controlling engines (IDs: 60, 92, 96...)
- **Lino "Engines"** (`/api/rest/v1/lino/engines`) - **SAME AS SHOWS** (legacy naming confusion)
- All Lino API `{engineId}` parameters are actually **Show IDs**

#### 4. Data Structure Initialization
Added proper initialization of new data structures in `index.js`:
- `shows` - Rich Show data from `/launcher` API
- `linoEngines` - Backward compatibility (same as shows)
- `rundownToShowMap` - Maps rundownId → showId for button triggers
- `primaryShowId` - First running Show ID
- `linoEngineId` - Backward compatibility

#### 5. Safety Improvements
- Added null safety checks for `config.features` and `config.interval`
- Improved error handling in `configUpdated()` method
- Added null checks for `inst.data.engines` in `features/nodes.js`

### Files Changed
- `features/engines.js` - Show status checks, rundownToShowMap building
- `features/rundowns.js` - Rundown filtering, item selection options
- `actions.js` - New playback control actions, Show status validation
- `variables.js` - Show status variables with dual property checks
- `presets.js` - Lino Playback presets, Show status indicators
- `index.js` - Data structure initialization, safety checks

### Related Dashboard Fixes
Fixed race condition in `rhub-api-dashboard` when switching Shows:
- Clear rundown selection before loading new rundowns
- Filter rundowns by `loadedRundownsInfo` to prevent 404 errors
- Disable non-started Shows in dropdown

---

## 2025-12-29: Version 2.1.1 - Skip Offline Lino Engines When Fetching Rundowns

### Problem
RealityHub server was logging excessive error messages when the companion module polled for rundowns:
```
INFO: Executing action: getRundowns for rundownEngineId: 81
TRACE: Cannot get rundown engine for rundownEngineId: 81, action: getRundowns
```

This occurred because the module was querying rundowns for ALL Lino engines, including those that were offline/not started.

### Root Cause
In `features/rundowns.js`, the code was iterating through all Lino engines:
```javascript
const linoEngineIds = Object.keys(inst.data.linoEngines)
```

This included offline engines (where `started: false`), causing errors on the RealityHub server.

### Solution
Filter Lino engines to only query those that are currently started/online:
```javascript
const linoEngineIds = Object.keys(inst.data.linoEngines).filter(id => inst.data.linoEngines[id].started === true)
```

The `started` property from the Lino engine API indicates whether an engine is currently active and ready to serve requests.

### Files Changed
- `features/rundowns.js` - Only query rundowns from started Lino engines

---

## 2025-12-28: Module Packaging for Offline Distribution

### Problem
`yarn pack` creates a `.tgz` archive with a `package/` root folder, but Bitfocus Companion expects `companion/manifest.json` at the root (or `pkg/` root when using official tools). The "Import module package" feature fails to find the manifest in standard `yarn pack` archives.

### Solution
Use the official Bitfocus Companion build tool (`@companion-module/tools`) which is now configured as the build script.

### How to Build for Distribution
1. Run `yarn build` in the module root.
2. The command executes `companion-module-build`.
3. It generates a properly structured `realityhub-[version].tgz`.
4. This file can be imported directly via the "Import module package" button in Companion.

### Configuration Changes
- Added `"build": "companion-module-build"` script to `package.json`.
- This ensures consistent, compliant packaging for future releases.

---

## 2025-12-28: Version 2.1.0 - Node 22 & RealityHub 2.1 Only

### Breaking Changes
- **Dropped RealityHub 2.0 support** - Module now requires RealityHub 2.1 only
- **API key is now required** - No longer optional for authentication

### Package Manager
- Switched from npm to **yarn** to align with Bitfocus Companion standards
- Removed `package-lock.json`, using `yarn.lock` exclusively

### Dependency Updates
| Package | Old Version | New Version |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| @companion-module/base | ~1.10.0 | ~1.14.1 |
| @companion-module/tools | ^1.5.0 | ^2.5.0 |

These updates add **Node 22 support** (engine requirement: `^18.12 || ^22.8`).

### Runtime Update
- Updated `manifest.json` runtime type from `node18` to `node22`
- Aligns with Bitfocus Companion's primary runtime environment

### Documentation Updates
- **configFields.js**: Updated info text and API key field (now required, not optional)
- **HELP.md**: Added detailed REST API key setup instructions:
  - User requires "REST API Management" right in RealityHub
  - Steps to create API key in User Management > REST API Keys
  - Explanation of Acquired Modules (Lino, Launcher, Nodegraph Editor)

### Files Changed
- `package.json` - Version bump to 2.1.0, dependency updates
- `yarn.lock` - Regenerated with new dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - Deleted (switched to yarn)
- `companion/manifest.json` - Runtime type node22
- `configFields.js` - RealityHub 2.1 only, API key required
- `companion/HELP.md` - REST API key setup instructions

## 2025-12-28: Critical Bug Fix - Lino Engine ID vs Reality Engine ID

### Problem
The module was failing to load rundown items with errors like:
```
Failed to load items for rundown "RD_125" (ID: 110)
HTTPError for "http://172.16.0.118/api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/42/49/items/?api_key=..."
```

Despite rundowns being visible in the RealityHub dashboard and accessible via direct API calls.

### Root Cause
**RealityHub has TWO completely different engine systems with separate ID namespaces:**

| System | Endpoint | Purpose | Example IDs |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Reality Engines | `GET /api/rest/v1/engines` | Physical render engines | 41, 42, 44, 54, 56, 71 |
| Lino Engines | `GET /api/rest/v1/lino/engines` | Rundown control engines | 60, 65, 77, 81, 89, 92 |

The companion module was incorrectly using Reality Engine IDs (e.g., `42`) for Lino API calls that require Lino Engine IDs (e.g., `77`).

### Example
- Rundown "RD_125" (ID: 110) belongs to **Lino Engine 77** ("Show 125")
- The module was calling: `GET /lino/rundown/42/110/items/` ❌
- Should have called: `GET /lino/rundown/77/110/items/` ✅

### Affected API Endpoints
All Lino endpoints that include `{engineId}` in the path require **Lino Engine IDs**, not Reality Engine IDs:

```
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundowns/{linoEngineId}
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{linoEngineId}/{rundownId}/items/
POST /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{linoEngineId}/{rundownId}/items/
POST /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{linoEngineId}/{rundownId}/items/{itemId}/buttons/{buttonKey}
PUT  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{linoEngineId}/play/{itemId}/{preview}
PUT  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{linoEngineId}/out/{itemId}/{preview}
... etc
```

### Solution
1. **`features/engines.js`**: Added call to `GET /api/rest/v1/lino/engines` to fetch Lino engines and store them in `inst.data.linoEngines`

2. **`features/rundowns.js`**: Modified to iterate through each Lino engine, fetch its rundowns, and store the `linoEngineId` with each rundown for later use

3. **`features/templates.js`**: Updated to search for template pool rundown across all Lino engines

4. **`actions.js`**: Updated button trigger actions to use the stored `linoEngineId` from each rundown instead of a global ID

### Files Changed
- `features/engines.js` - Fetch and store Lino engines
- `features/rundowns.js` - Use Lino engine IDs for rundown/item queries
- `features/templates.js` - Use Lino engine IDs for template pool
- `actions.js` - Use correct Lino engine ID when triggering buttons

### Reference Implementation
The `rhub-api-dashboard` project correctly handles this in `src/lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
lino: {
    listEngines: () => request('GET', '/api/rest/v1/lino/engines'),
    listRundowns: (engineId: number) => request('GET', `/api/rest/v1/lino/rundowns/${engineId}`),
    listItems: (engineId: number, rundownId: number) => request('GET', `/api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/${engineId}/${rundownId}/items/`),
    // ...
}
```

### Debugging Tip
Use the MCP server to verify correct engine IDs:
```
mcp_rhub-mcp-server_get_v1_lino_eng
```
This returns Lino engines with their `loadedRundownsInfo` showing which rundowns belong to which Lino engine.

---

## 2025-12-28: API Key Authentication

### Issue
Some API calls were failing silently.

### Solution
The module now sends the API key both as:
1. HTTP Header: `X-API-Key: {apiKey}`
2. Query Parameter: `?api_key={apiKey}`

This matches the approach used in `rhub-mcp-server/index.js` for maximum compatibility across all RealityHub API endpoints.

**Note:** This was later changed (2025-01-XX) to header-only authentication for improved security. See "Security Improvement - API Key Authentication Method" entry.

---

## 2025-12-28: Playout API Deprecation Note

### Status
✅ **Verified**: The companion module does NOT use any deprecated Playout endpoints.

### Background
RealityHub has two rundown control APIs:

| API | Status | Playback Control | Button Triggers |
|-----|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Playout** (`/api/rest/v1/playout/*`) | ⚠️ DEPRECATED | ❌ No play/out/continue | ✅ Yes |
| **Lino** (`/api/rest/v1/lino/*`) | ✅ Current | ✅ Full control | ✅ Yes |

### Playout Endpoints (DO NOT USE)
```
GET  /api/rest/v1/playout/rundowns
GET  /api/rest/v1/playout/rundowns/{rundownId}
GET  /api/rest/v1/playout/rundowns/{rundownId}/items
POST /api/rest/v1/playout/rundowns/{rundownId}/items/{itemId}/{buttonKey}
GET  /api/rest/v1/playout/templates
```

### Lino Endpoints (USE THESE)
```
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/engines
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundowns/{engineId}
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/{rundownId}/items/
POST /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/{rundownId}/items/{itemId}/buttons/{buttonKey}
PUT  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/play/{itemId}/{preview}
PUT  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/out/{itemId}/{preview}
PUT  /api/rest/v1/lino/rundown/{engineId}/continue/{itemId}/{preview}
GET  /api/rest/v1/lino/templates
```

### Key Difference
Lino requires a **Lino Engine ID** in the path, while Playout uses only rundown IDs. See the "Lino Engine ID vs Reality Engine ID" section above for details on obtaining correct Lino Engine IDs.

---

## 2025-12-28: Dynamic Rundown Presets Feature

### Feature Added
Created dynamic presets from rundown item buttons:
- Scans all Lino engines for rundowns
- Extracts buttons from each rundown item
- Creates presets categorized as "Rundown: {rundownName}"
- Users can drag and drop these button presets into their Companion button grid

### Files Changed
- `presets.js` - Added rundown preset generation
- `features/rundowns.js` - Added preset refresh on rundown data update

### Legacy Template Pool
The "Rundown-Name For Templates" config field now supports:
- Specific rundown name (e.g., "CompanionTemplatesPool") for legacy behavior
- Empty or "*" to disable template pool sync and only use the new Rundowns feature
